# Theory of Programming Languages – Project Collection

A collection of small programming projects written in **Swift, Scheme (Racket), and Prolog** for a course on programming language concepts. The assignments explore different programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and logic programming.

These projects demonstrate foundational skills useful for software, data, and technical problem-solving roles, including recursion, data structures, parsing, and algorithmic thinking.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### **1. Swift – Student Grading & Analytics Program**
- Parses structured data from a file (`scores.dat`)
- Stores student records using classes and dictionaries
- Calculates total points, letter grades, class averages, and highest scores
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming and basic data analytics

### **2. Scheme (Racket) – Recursive List Functions**
- Implements classical list-processing functions:
  - `area`, `power`, `countZero`, `reverse`, `palindrome`, `merge`
- Demonstrates functional programming, recursion, and pattern matching
- Shows comfort with immutable data and recursive logic

### **3. Prolog – Logic Programming Predicates**
- Implements logical rules for:
  - Membership checking
  - Even/odd evaluation
  - Counting even numbers in a list
  - Minimum value in a list
  - Checking palindromes
  - Counting binary tree leaf nodes
- Demonstrates declarative programming and recursive inference rules

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, dictionaries, modular design (Swift)  
- **Functional Programming:** Recursion, list operations, immutability (Scheme)  
- **Logic Programming:** Pattern matching, unification, declarative reasoning (Prolog)  
- **Data Processing:** Parsing text files, computing aggregates  
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Traversing lists and trees, building recursive solutions
