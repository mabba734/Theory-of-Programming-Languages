# Theory of Programming Languages – Course Projects

This folder contains my programming assignments for **CSCI 3210: Theory of Programming Languages**.  
The course introduces major programming paradigms and the core ideas behind how languages are designed and implemented.  
Each project was completed in a different language to explore how programming concepts change across paradigms.

## Included Languages & Paradigms
- **Swift (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Scheme / Racket (Functional Programming)**
- **Prolog (Logic Programming)**

## Projects

### Swift – Object-Oriented Programming
Implements a student grading and analytics program using classes, dictionaries, file handling, and basic data processing.

### Scheme / Racket – Functional Programming
Recursive list-processing functions, including:
- reverse
- palindrome checking
- merging lists
- power function
- counting zeros
These demonstrate functional thinking, immutability, and recursive logic.

### Prolog – Logic Programming
Declarative predicates for:
- membership testing
- even/odd evaluation
- counting even numbers
- finding the minimum in a list
- checking palindromes
- counting leaf nodes in a binary tree

## Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of different programming paradigms  
- Recursion and mathematical function design  
- List and tree processing  
- Declarative logic and pattern matching  
- Cross-language problem solving
