# Student Grading & Analytics Program (Swift)

A Swift-based grading system that reads structured data from a file, processes student records, and outputs analytics such as total scores, letter grades, class averages, and highest-performing metrics. Designed to demonstrate strong foundations in data handling, object-oriented programming, and basic analytical computation.

## Highlights for Tech/Data Roles
- **Data Processing:** Parses and validates structured input from `scores.dat`
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Implements `Student` and `Roster` classes with encapsulated logic
- **Analytics:** Computes averages, maximum values, and grade distributions
- **Data Structures:** Uses Swift dictionaries for fast record lookup
- **User Interaction:** Supports querying student records by ID
- **File I/O:** Reads and processes external data using Swift’s Foundation library

## Features
- Load and store student data using custom classes
- Automatically calculate total points and letter grades
- Compute class-wide statistics (averages + highest scores)
- Query specific students through user input
- Print a complete roster report

## Run Instructions
Ensure `scores.dat` is in the same folder and run:
